Support Specialist,Vesta,2025-05-11T14:00:03+00:00,1746972003,Remote,"system, security, support, software, financial, finance, cloud, engineering","What we're doing:
Owning a home is a foundational part of building financial security and wealth in America. However, the tools and technology that support homeownership are antiquated, dependent on things like fax machines, handwritten documentation, and hours of manual review.
We're here to change it.
Vesta is the next-generation system of record to power the multi-trillion mortgage market. We believe that we are overdue for a core transformation – that in order to build a fully automated process and fully digital customer journeys, lenders will have to adopt a system of record platform that is modern, open, and orchestrated by best-in-class software workflows.
Who we are:
Our founding team is no stranger to the complexities of the financial industry. As early employees at Blend, they spent years together focused on creating modern cloud infrastructure for banks. Now, with Vesta, they are transforming the mortgage industry by creating the most flexible, open and automated origination experience, benefiting financial institutions and their customers.
And, we're not alone.
We've raised $55M from top tier investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Conversion Capital, Zigg Capital, and Index Ventures.
We believe that our team is our greatest competitive advantage and take pride in having a team of exceptional humans. As a team, we value humility, empathy, self-awareness, and an orientation towards action. If this sounds like you and you're excited by the idea of getting in at the ground level to be part of building the infrastructure that will power the future of the finance industry, we would love to hear from you!
Who you are:
You are comfortable learning and working with software tools, and you are willing to dive in to the details of how our system interacts with other software providers. You are comfortable navigating APIs, webhooks, and XML, and you aren't afraid to learn more.
You are passionate about solving customer problems in order to help them achieve their goals. You can deeply empathize with user pain points and questions (perhaps because you've experienced them before yourself).
You are curious, persistent, and like problem-solving! You like to get to the ""why"" and won't stop until you figure it out. Complex problems are your favorite, and you're willing to dig deep to get to a solution.
You're looking to join an early-stage team to build something BIG, something industry-changing, and you're excited about being part of that quickly-moving, fast-growing journey.
As a bonus, you might have some experience working within or around the mortgage industry, navigating and working with mortgage technology systems, ideally on the business process, or technical/IT side.
About the role:
As one of our first support specialists at Vesta, you'll work closely with our customers to guide them on our product, troubleshoot and escalate issues to our product and engineering teams, all to ultimately make our customers successful. In this role, you can expect to:
\n
engage with Vesta's customers through various communication channels, namely Zendesk, to work with them on issues, errors, product questions, bugs, and product feedback
initially troubleshoot issues or questions yourself by using our internal debugging tools, looking for steps to reproduce the issue, or providing explanations on how to use Vesta
collaborate with our product and engineering teams when needed, clearly communicating the customer problems, and providing context and other materials that will aid in resolving the issue
become a Vesta product expert, understanding a large breadth of functionality within the platform in order to clearly and effectively explain to users how to navigate the product
have an eye towards scalability by documenting product functionality and new feature releases in our help center so that users can self serve
observe and communicate trends in customer feedback or pain points to our product, design, and engineering teams, to help identify areas of our product that may be particularly confusing or error-prone
be an indispensable part of delivering industry-changing software to our customers!
Perks + Benefits:
Robust medical, vision, & dental coverage (~100% of employee premiums are covered)
401(K) plan offering
Meaningful parental leave - 16 weeks fully paid for all new parents, birthing & non-birthing parents (applies to adoptions as well!)
Remote-first culture with a hub in San Francisco
Generous Work-From-Anywhere & Wellness Benefits
Monthly Doordash benefits
Open & encouraged flexible time off
Company offsites to get to know the team!
\n
Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $80,000 - $120,000/yr.  Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.
At Vesta, we believe that the only way we can tackle the challenging problems in front of us is by having diverse perspectives and an environment that promotes inclusivity. We're committed to equal opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender, gender identity, parental or pregnancy status, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, or veteran status.

Outstanding critical thinking skills; low ego, high curiosity and comfort in being wrong
A love for great software; desire to understand the why and the how of everything you work on
Demonstrated ability to apply existing skills to new technologies
Growth mindset; a desire to learn from and mentor those around you
Strong communication and collaboration skills, especially written

Will pay in stablecoins or fiat
Philosophies for a culture that show we care: Take vacation when you need it, family care, training and development (just to name a few)

Alongside this, you'll be reviewing and strengthening our KYC, CDD, EDD, and ongoing monitoring processes to ensure they stay effective and proportionate to our risk exposure.
You'll also help to develop and update internal financial crime policies, procedures, and guidance, ensuring they remain aligned with regulatory expectations and the evolving crypto landscape.

Generation
, we believe in the power of employment to change lives. We are a global nonprofit organization that supports adults to achieve economic mobility through employment. Generation trains and places adult learners of all ages into careers that are otherwise inaccessible, working in partnership with governments, employers, and other system actors. We also conduct original research and share data insights on high priority global workforce transition topics to inform decision-making by workforce system stakeholders. Launched in 2015, Generation comprises a global hub (Generation You Employed, or GYE) and a network of in-country affiliates. To date, the network has 100,000+ graduates and 11,000+ employers across 46 professions and 17 countries.
When learners join Generation, 91% are unemployed, of which nearly half are long-term unemployed.  Three months after completing our program, graduates have an 78% job placement rate, rising to 88% within six months. Of our employed graduates, 68% are hired by repeat employers who have previously hired Generation graduates, and 89% are in jobs directly related to the profession for which we have trained them. Employed graduates immediately earn an average of 3-4X their previous earnings.  Two to five years after graduation, 77% of our alumni from upper-middle income countries continue to meet their daily financial needs and 63% can save for the future. To date, Generation's global graduates have earned more than $1 billion in wages. Generation graduates typically have a secondary school background, 54% are female, 34% have dependents, and the majority identify with underrepresented communities in their country.
